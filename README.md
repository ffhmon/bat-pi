# Bat project

Here you find some Python scripts and other resources that were created for bat surveys as part of a flora, fauna and habitat (FFH) monitoring project in Germany.<br>
<br>
Some scripts involve mass data handling of bat call recordings from the Bat-Pi 1, a Raspberry Pi based ultrasonic bat call recorder. For more information on the Bat-Pi device, please see http://www.bat-pi.eu/EN/index-EN.html<br>
<br>
Other scripts involve georeferencing and handling of sonogram screenshots from the SSF BAT 3 hand held bat detector.<br>
Pease see http://www.mekv.de/bat3/index.htm for more information on that device. (German website)<br>
<br>
The code is provided in the hope that it is helpful to other bat friends and nature enthousiasts.
