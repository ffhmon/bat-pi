# Bat projects

Here you find some Python scripts and other resources that were created for a bat survey project.<br>
<br>
Some scripts involve the handling of data from the Bat-Pi 1, a Raspberry Pi based ultrasonic bat call recorder.<br>
For more information on this great project, please see http://www.bat-pi.eu/EN/index-EN.html<br>
<br>
Other scripts involve the handling and georeferncing of sonogram screenshots from the SSF BAT 3 hand held bat detector.<br>
Pease see http://www.mekv.de/bat3/index.htm for more information on that device. (German website)<br>
